# ff_network
Implementation of the standard feed forward network in Cuda C.
 
## Theoretical Indroduction

A feed forward network consists of the following data.
. A sequence of based vectorspaces $$V_1,...,V_n$$.
. A sequence of linear maps $$A_i:V_i\to V_i+1$$.
. A sequence of smooth maps $$g_i:V_i\to V_i$$.
